   Here are some of my favorite Marvel characters and why I think they’re awesome:
  <hr />
   Thor: The God of Thunder, Thor is known for his incredible strength, his magical hammer Mjölnir, and his journey from a brash warrior to a wise leader. His character development, especially in movies like “Thor: Ragnarok” and “Thor: Love and Thunder,” is truly captivating.
  <hr />
   Iron Man (Tony Stark): Tony Stark’s transformation from a self-centered billionaire to a self-sacrificing hero is one of the most compelling arcs in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). His intelligence, wit, and the iconic Iron Man suit make him a standout character.
  <hr />
   Captain America (Steve Rogers): Steve Rogers embodies the ideals of bravery, honor, and perseverance. His journey from a scrawny kid to the super-soldier Captain America is inspiring, and his leadership in the Avengers is unmatched.
  <hr />
   Deadpool: Known for his irreverent humor and breaking the fourth wall, Deadpool brings a unique and hilarious twist to the superhero genre. His ability to heal rapidly and his unconventional approach to heroism make him a fan favorite.
  <hr />
   Wolverine (Logan): Wolverine’s rugged demeanor, adamantium claws, and healing factor make him one of the most iconic X-Men. His complex past and struggle with his inner demons add depth to his character.</p>
